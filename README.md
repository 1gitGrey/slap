âœ‹ slap
======

slap is a Sublime-like terminal-based text editor that strives to make editing
from the terminal easier. It has:

* first-class mouse support
* GUI editor-like [keybindings](slap.ini#L51)[*](#some-keys-dont-work)
* copying/pasting with OS clipboard support
* undo/redo
* syntax highlighting for [many languages](https://github.com/isagalaev/highlight.js/tree/master/src/languages)
* a Sublime-like file sidebar
* select word to highlight other occurrences; double-click to select word
* easy-to-use finding with regex support
* bracket matching
* ... many other features that will make you leave nano, vim, and emacs behind

Installation
------------

Make sure an up-to-date version of [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/download/) is installed, then:

    $ sudo npm install -g slap

Note: Some operating systems ship a version of NodeJS which might be too old. Please make sure to visit [Node's official installation guide](https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/installing-node.js-via-package-manager).

If `npm install -g slap` doesn't work, try using HTTP instead of HTTPS:

    $ npm config set registry http://registry.npmjs.org/

Usage
-----

    $ slap file.c # open a file
    $ slap file1.c file2.c # open two files
    $ slap . # open current directory
    $ slap # open a new file in current directory

### Configuration

You can pass options in via command line:

    $ slap --header.style.bg red file.c

Or equivalently, you can use `~/.slap/config`:

    [header.style]
    bg = "red"

All configuration options and their defaults are documented [here](slap.ini).

OS support
----------

### OSX

iTerm2 works best. Terminal.app does not support some default keybindings but
mouse support works well with the [MouseTerm](https://bitheap.org/mouseterm/)
[SIMBL](http://www.culater.net/software/SIMBL/SIMBL.php) plugin.

### Linux

If you are using X.Org, ensure xclip is installed for OS clipboard support.

### Windows

Most terminal emulators in Windows do not support mouse events, PuTTY being a
notable exception. In Cygwin, slap crashes on startup due to
[joyent/node#6459](https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/6459).

troubleshooting, theme/plugin/core development, or palm strike discussion of any
nature.

### Some keys don't work!

Unfortunately most terminal emulators do not support certain keystrokes and as
such there is no way to handle them. These include `C-backspace`, `S-home/end`,
and `S-pageup/down`. Most of these actions have alternate keybindings, inspired
by emacs and other editors, but if you find one that doesn't work, please
[submit an issue](../../issues/new)!

### Too slow!

Try `--editor.highlight false` or adding the following to `~/.slap/config`:

    [editor]
    highlight = false

If that doesn't improve performance, please run with `--perf.profile true` and
[submit an issue](../../issues/new) with the newly-created `v8.log` file.
